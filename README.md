### Hi there 👋

🔭 I currently work on developing responsible AI tools in open source and Azure Machine Learning. In my spare time I like to write. Some of my writing samples can be found at [Some Simplistic Thinking](https://somesimplisticthinking.blogspot.com/). Some of the other technical articles that I have contributed are below:-
- [Optimizing pytest runtime](https://medium.com/p/70a348122eec)
- [Different ways of getting python version](https://github.com/gaugup/PythonPLResources/blob/main/WaysToGetPythonVersion/WaysToGetPythonVersion.md)

I am also the maintainer of the following open projects:-
- [data.understand](https://github.com/ggupta2005/data.understand)
- [flake8-all-not-strings](https://github.com/ggupta2005/flake8-all-not-strings)
